# IPL Score Prediction Using Neural Network (Deep Learning)

## Description:
The dynamic and unpredictable nature of cricket, especially in tournaments like the Indian Premier League (IPL), poses a significant challenge for teams, analysts, and fans alike. Accurate score predictions can enhance strategic decisions, improve fan engagement, and provide competitive advantages. However, traditional methods often fall short due to the complexity and variability of in-game factors.

This project aims to address these challenges by developing a robust neural network model capable of predicting IPL scores with high accuracy. Leveraging deep learning, we seek to capture intricate patterns and dependencies within the data that traditional models may overlook. By doing so, we provide valuable insights and predictive capabilities that meet the demands of real-time decision-making in this fast-paced sport.

## Project Highlights:
• Developed a sophisticated neural network model to predict IPL match scores with high accuracy.
• Analyzed and processed a comprehensive dataset encompassing various factors such as match venues, competing teams, and individual player performances.
• Implemented cutting-edge deep learning techniques to capture the complexity and dynamics of cricket gameplay.
• Designed an interactive interface using Jupyter widgets for easy input and visualization of predictions.

## Business Impact:
This model has significant potential for various stakeholders in the cricket industry, including:
• IPL Teams: Enhanced strategy planning
• Broadcasting Media: Improved content quality and viewer engagement
• Fan Engagement Platforms: Development of more engaging interactive content
